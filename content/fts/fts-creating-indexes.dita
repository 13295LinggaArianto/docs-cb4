    Full Text Searches are supported by specially purposed indexes, which can be created from the
    Couchbase Web Console.

        Indexes and Full Text Search
      </title>
      
      <p>
        Every Full Text Search is performed with reference
        to a user-created <i>Full Text Index</i>. On creation of the index, 
        its elements are mapped to the
        documents and fields of a bucket. If the bucket contains
        documents of different <i>types</i> (for example, <codeph>airline</codeph> documents
        versus <codeph>hotel</codeph> documents), each document-type can be assigned its own
        index-mapping. Each index-mapping in turn can be assigned its own <i>analyzer</i>, can
        be applied to a specific subset of document-fields, and can be explicitly included in
        or excluded from the index.
        Searches can be performed across multiple buckets, by means
        of an <i>index alias</i>.

        Index-creation can be performed by means of the Couchbase Web Console. The basic
        procedure is outlined in 
        <xref href="./fts-searching-from-the-ui.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Searching from the UI</xref>.
        The current page explains the more
        advanced aspects of index-creation, and shows how they can be
        managed from the console.

        Accessing and Managing Full Text Indexes
      </title>
      
      <p>
        Full Text Indexes are different from the <i>Global</i> indexes that are
        accessed under the <b>Indexes</b> tab in the left-hand navigation panel of the Couchbase
        Web Console. Full Text Indexes are accessed from the <b>Search</b> tab: left-click on 
        this to display the <b>Full Text Search</b> panel, which
        contains a tabular presentation of currently existing indexes, with a row for each
        index. (See
        <xref href="./fts-searching-from-the-ui.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Searching from the UI</xref>.)
        To manage an index, left-click on its row. The row expands, as
        follows:
      </p>

        Three buttons are displayed:

        <ul>
          
          <li>
            
            <uicontrol>Delete</uicontrol> causes the current index to be deleted.

          <li>
            
            <uicontrol>Clone</uicontrol> brings up the <b>Clone Index</b> screen, which allows the a copy

            <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol> brings up the <b>Edit Index</b> screen, which allows
            the index to be modified.
            Saving modifications causes the index to be rebuilt.

      <title>
        Specifying Type Identifiers
      </title>
      
      <p>
        A <i>type identifier</i> allows the documents in a bucket to be identified by the index
        according to their <i>type</i>. When the
        <uicontrol>Add Index</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Edit Index</uicontrol>, or <uicontrol>Clone Index</uicontrol>
        screen is accessed, a <uicontrol>Type Identifer</uicontrol> panel is displayed:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <image href="./images/fts-type-identifier-ui.png" id="fts_type_identifer_ui" align="left" width="460"/>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Three options are provided, whereby the type of each document within the bucket can be
        identified by the index:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        
        <li>
          <b>JSON type field</b>: The name of a document-field. The value
          of this field is used by the index to determine the type of the document. 
          The default field-name is <codeph>type</codeph>: meaning that the index searches for a field
          in each document whose name is <codeph>type</codeph>: each document that
          contains a field with
          that name is duly included in the index, with the 
          value of the field specifying the type of the document. Note that the value cannot be
          an array or JSON object.
          
          <p>
            
          </p>
          
        </li>
        
        
        <li>
          <b>Doc ID up to separator</b>: The characters in the ID of each document,
          up to but not including the separator. For example, if the document's
          ID is <codeph>hotel_10123</codeph>, the value <codeph>hotel</codeph> is
          determined by the index to be the type of the document.
          
          <p>
            
          </p>
          
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <b>Doc ID with regex</b>: A regular expression that is applied by the
          index to the ID of each document. The resulting value is determined to
          be the type of the document. (This option may be used when the targeted document-subset
          features neither a <codeph>type</codeph> field nor an ID that follows
          a naming convention suitable for <b>Doc ID up to separator</b>.)
          
          <p>
            
          </p>
          
        </li>

    <section id="specifying-type-mappings">
      
      <title>
        Specifying Type Mappings
      </title>
      
      <p>
        Whereas a <i>type identifer</i> tells the index how to determine
        the position in each document of the characters 
        that specify the document's type, a <i>type mapping</i> specifies the 
        characters themselves. Thus, if <b>Doc ID up to separator</b> is used
        as a type identifier, a type mapping of <i>hotel</i> ensures that
        <codeph>hotel_10123</codeph>, rather than <codeph>airline_10</codeph>, is indexed
      </p>
      
      <p>
        When the
        <uicontrol>Add Index</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Edit Index</uicontrol>, or <uicontrol>Clone Index</uicontrol>
        screen is accessed, the <uicontrol>Type Mappings</uicontrol> panel can be opened. The
        default setting is displayed:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <image href="./images/fts-type-mappings-ui-closed.png" id="fts_type_mappings_ui_closed" align="left" width="700"/>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Left-click on the <uicontrol>+ Add Type Mapping</uicontrol> button. The display now
        appears as follows:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <image href="./images/fts-type-mappings-ui-add.png" id="fts_type_mappings_ui_add" align="left" width="700"/>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The display indicates that a single type mapping is currently defined, which is 
        <codeph>default</codeph>. This is a special type mapping
        created by every index automatically: it is applied to each document 
        whose type <i>either</i> does not match a user-specified type mapping,
        <i>or</i> has no type attribute. Therefore, if the default mapping is
        left enabled, all documents are included in the index, regardless of
        whether the user actively specifies type mappings. To ensure that only
        documents corresponding to the user's specified type mappings are included
        in the index, the default type mapping must be disabled (see below for an
        example).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        To specify a type mapping, type the string (for example, <codeph>hotel</codeph>) 
        into the interactive text field. Note the <uicontrol>only index specified fields</uicontrol>
        checkbox: if this is checked, only specified fields from the document are
        included in the index. (For an example, see
        <xref href="./fts-creating-indexes.dita#specifying-fields" scope="local" format="dita">Specifying Fields</xref>, below.)
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Optionally, an <i>analyzer</i> can be specified for the type mapping. A list of
        available analyzers can be accessed and selected from, by means of the pull-down
        menu to the right of the interactive text-field:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <image href="./images/fts-type-mappings-ui-analyzers-menu.png" id="fts_type_mappings_ui_analyzers_menu" align="left" width="480"/>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The default value, <codeph>inherit</codeph>, means that the type mapping inherits the
        default analyzer, specified in the <uicontrol>Advanced</uicontrol> panel, described
        below in
        <xref href="./fts-creating-indexes.dita#specifying-advanced-settings" scope="local" format="dita">Specifying Advanced Settings</xref>. 
        Note that custom analyzers can be created and stored for the index undergoing
        definition, by means of the <uicontrol>Analyzers</uicontrol> panel, described below in
        <xref href="./fts-creating-indexes.dita#creating-analyzers" scope="local" format="dita">Creating Analyzers</xref>.
        All custom analyzers are available for association with a type mapping, and are
        thus added to the pull-down menu shown above.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Additional information on analyzers can also be found on the page
        <xref href="./fts-using-analyzers.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Using Analyzers</xref>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Left-click on <uicontrol>OK</uicontrol> to save.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The <uicontrol>Type Mappings</uicontrol> panel now appears as follows:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <image href="./images/fts-type-mappings-ui-addition-both-checked.png" id="fts_type_mappings_ui_addition_both_checked" align="left" width="500"/>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Note that the checkbox to the left of each of the two specified type mappings,
        <codeph>hotel</codeph> and <codeph>default</codeph>, is checked. Because
        <codeph>deafult</codeph> is checked, <i>all</i> documents in the bucket (not
        merely those that correspond to the <codeph>hotel</codeph> type mapping) will be
        included in the index. To ensure that only <codeph>hotel</codeph> documents
        are included, <i>uncheck</i> the checkbox for <codeph>default</codeph>. The panel
        now appears as follows:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <image href="./images/fts-type-mappings-ui-addition-default-unchecked.png" id="fts_type_mappings_ui_addition_default_unchecked" align="left" width="500"/>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Note also that should you wish to ensure that all documents in the bucket are included
        in the index <i>except</i> those that correspond to the <codeph>hotel</codeph> type
        mapping, <i>uncheck</i> the checkbox for <codeph>hotel</codeph>:
      </p>

        A Full Text Index can be defined not only to include (or exclude)
        documents of a certain <i>type</i>,
        but also to include (or exclude) specified <i>fields</i> within each of the typed 
        documents.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        To specify one or more fields, hover with the mouse cursor over a row in the
        <b>Type Mappings</b> panel that contains an enabled type mapping. Buttons labeled
        <uicontrol>edit</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>+</uicontrol> appear:

      <p>
        Left-clicking on the <uicontrol>edit</uicontrol> button displays the following interface:

      </p>
      
      <p>
        This allows the mapping to be deleted, or associated with a different anlyzer. Left-clicking
        on the <uicontrol>+</uicontrol> button displays a pop-up that features two options:

          returned values; when unchecked, the field-content is not so included. Note that
          inclusion of field-content specifically permits <i>highlighting</i> of results, so that matched
          expressions can be easily seen; and generally assists in debugging procedures. However, it also results in larger indexes and
          longer processing-times.

          the field specified by default in the <uicontrol>Advanced</uicontrol>
          panel. When unchecked, the field is not so
          included. Inclusion means that when <i>query strings</i> are used to
          specify searches, the text in the current field is searchable without
          the field-name requiring a prefix (thus, a search on
          <codeph>description:modern</codeph> can be accomplished simply by specifying
          <codeph>modern</codeph>).

          vectors are included. When unchecked, term vectors are not
          included. Term vectors are the locations of terms
          in a particular field. Certain kinds of functionality (such as snippets, highlighting, and phrase
          search) require term vectors. Non-inclusion of term vectors
          results in smaller indexes and faster index build-times.

        Creating Analyzers
      </title>
      
      <p>
        Analyzers increase search-awareness by transforming input text into token-streams, which
        allow richer and more finely controlled matching. An analyzer consists of modules, each of
        which performs a particular role in the transformation: modules are provided for removing
        undesirable characters; for transforming dictionary-based words into non-dictionary-based
        search tokens; and for performing miscellaneous post-processing activities. 
        For more information on analyzers, see
        <xref href="./fts-using-analyzers.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Using Analyzers</xref>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        A default selection of analyzers is made available from the pull-down menu provided by the
        <uicontrol>Type Mappings</uicontrol> interface, discussed above. Additional analyzers can
        be custom-created, by means of the <uicontrol>Analyzers</uicontrol> panel, which appears
        as follows:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <image href="./images/fts-analyzers-panel-initial.png" id="fts_analyzers_panel_initial" align="left" width="500"/>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        To create a new analyzer, left-click on the <uicontrol>+ Add Analyzer</uicontrol> button. The
        <b>Custom Analyzer</b> dialog appears:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <image href="./images/fts-custom-analyzer-dialog-initial.png" id="fts_custom_analyzer_dialog_initial" align="left" width="360"/>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The dialog contains four interactive panels.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Name</b>: A suitable name for the analyzer.
          
          <p>
            
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <b>Character Filters</b>: One or more available character filters. (These
          strip out undesirable characters from input: for example, the <codeph>html</codeph> 
          character filter ignores HTML tags, and indexes HTML text-content alone.) To select from the
          list of available character filters, use the pull-down menu:
          
          <p>
            <image href="./images/fts-analyzers-panel-select-char-filter.png" id="fts_custom_analyzer_panel_select_char_filter" align="left" width="480"/>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Following addition of one character filter, to add another, left-click
            on the <uicontrol>+ Add</uicontrol> button, to the right of the field.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            For an explanation of character filters, see

        </li>
        
        <li>
          <b>Tokenizer</b>: One of the available tokenizers. (These
          split input-strings into individual 
          <i>tokens</i>, which together are made into a <i>token stream</i>. Typically, 
          a token is established for each word.) The default value is
          <codeph>unicode</codeph>. To select from a list of all tokenizers available,
          use the pull-down menu:

          </p>
          
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <b>Token Filter</b>: One or more of the available token filters. (When specified, these
          are chained together, to perform additional post-processing on the token stream.) To select
          from the list of available filters, use the pull-down menu:
          
          <p>
            <image href="./images/fts-analyzers-panel-select-token-filter.png" id="fts_custom_analyzer_panel_select_token_filter" align="left" width="480"/>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Following addition of one token filter, to add another, left-click
            on the <uicontrol>+ Add</uicontrol> button, to the right of the field.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            For more information on token filters, see
            <xref href="./fts-using-analyzers.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Using Analyzers</xref>.

      <p>
        Once these fields have been appropriately completed, save; by left-clicking
        on the <uicontrol>Save</uicontrol> button. On the <b>Edit Index</b> screen,
        the newly defined analyzer now appears in the <b>Analyzers</b> panel, with
        available options displayed for further editing, or deleting. For

      <title>Using Index Aliases</title>
      
        <p>
          An <i>index alias</i> points to other, real Full Text Indexes; as such, its functions like
          a symbolic link in a filesystem.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          This permits <i>indirection</i> in naming, whereby applications can refer to an alias-name that never changes,
          while administrators are free periodically to change the identity of the real index pointed
          to by the alias. This may be useful when an index needs to be updated: to avoid down-time, 
          while the current index remains in service, a clone of
          the current index can be created, modified, and tested. Then, when
          the clone is ready, the existing alias can be retargeted at the clone, so that the clone becomes the current
          index; and the (now) previous index removed.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          An alias can refer to multiple indexes; and also to one or more additional aliases. Queries on such an alias
          are performed on all ultimate targets, and merged results are provided. 
        </p>
      
        <p>
          To create an Index Alias, access the <b>Full Text Search</b> screen, by left-clicking on the <uicontrol>Search</uicontrol>
          tab, in the navigation bar at the left of the console. The <b>Full Text Aliases</b> panel is displayed in the lower section
          of the page: 
        </p>
      
        <p>
          <image href="./images/fts-full-text-aliases-panel.png" id="fts_full_text_aliases_panel" align="left" width="560"/>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Left-clicking on the <uicontrol>Add Alias</uicontrol> button displays the <b>Add Alias</b> screen: 
        </p>
      
        <p>
          <image href="./images/fts-add-alias-screen.png" id="fts_add_alias_screen" align="left" width="520"/>
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The <b>Name</b> field allows an appropriate name for the alias to be entered. The <b>Target Indexes</b> pane displays the
          defined indexes available to be included in the alias. To select indexes within this pane, left-click on each: when the
          index-name is highlighted, the index has been selected.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          To create the alias, left-click on the <uicontrol>Create Index Alias</uicontrol> button. The saved index now appears on its
          own row in the <b>Full Text Aliases</b> area of the <b>Full Text Search</b> screen:

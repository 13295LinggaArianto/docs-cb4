<h1>Release Notes</h1>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Couchbase Operator is a Kubernetes native integration that enables
you to automate the management of common Couchbase tasks such as the
configuration, creation, and scaling of Couchbase clusters. The
Couchbase Operator 0.7 [Beta] was released in February 2018.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We consider beta releases to have some rough edges and bugs and hence
are intended for development purposes only. Since the release is still
under active development, you can have a big impact on the final version
of the product and its documentation by providing feedback and
observations.</p>

<h3 id="limitations"><a class="anchor" href="#limitations"></a>Limitations</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Beta release has the following limitations:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is no CRD validation at this time, so the Couchbase
configurations uploaded to Kubernetes are not verified by the Couchbase
Operator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Couchbase Operator can only failover one node at a time in the
cluster during auto-failover. This means that if multiple nodes fail,
some manual intervention is needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Couchbase Operator does not support the use of Persistent Volumes.</p>
</li>
</ul>

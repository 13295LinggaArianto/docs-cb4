  <title>Query Monitoring</title>
  <shortdesc>Couchbase Server 5.0 introduces new UI that allows you to monitor the current state of
    query service. </shortdesc>
  <body>
    <note>Query Monitoring is an Enterprise Edition only feature.</note>
    <p dir="ltr">From the <uicontrol>Couchbase Web Console</uicontrol> >
        <uicontrol>Query</uicontrol> > <uicontrol>Query Monitor</uicontrol>, you can view the
      different types queries that are Active (currently running), Completed (recently run), and
      Prepared (aggregate statistics for prepared queries). Statistics information for the query
      service is displayed at the bottom of the page. Different information may be shown depending
      on the userâ€™s access control role.</p>

    </p>
    <p dir="ltr">The information about these queries is automatically updated every 5 seconds. To
      freeze the display updates, click <uicontrol>pause</uicontrol> located above the query table,
      next to the table heading. When paused, a <uicontrol>resume</uicontrol> button becomes
      available to let you restart automatic updates. You can sort the query information table by
      clicking on any of the column headers. </p>

      <title>Active Queries</title>
      <p>By default, the <uicontrol>Active Queries</uicontrol> page is displayed on the Query
        Monitoring screen. The currently running queries are displayed, showing the details such as
        the query syntax, the query node address where the query is running, duration, request
        identification number, and the current state of the query. Click the
          <uicontrol>edit</uicontrol> link to edit that particular query in the <uicontrol>Query
          Editor</uicontrol>. To cancel a long running query, click the
          <uicontrol>cancel</uicontrol> link located on the right side of the row. </p>

      <title>Completed Queries</title>
      <p>From the <uicontrol>Couchbase Web Console > Query > Query Monitor ></uicontrol> click the
          <uicontrol>Completed</uicontrol> button to view the table of completed queries whose
        runtime exceeded a system-specified threshold (default 1 second). Each row shows the query
        syntax, the query node address where the query was run, duration, the result count, the
        final state of the query (for example, completed, cancelled), and the timestamp when the
        query was run. </p>

      <p>From the <uicontrol>Couchbase Web Console > Query > Query Monitor ></uicontrol> click the
          <uicontrol>Prepared</uicontrol> button to view the prepared queries. This page displays
        the aggregate statistics for prepared queries showing details such as query syntax, average
        elapsed time, number of uses, and the query node address. </p>
